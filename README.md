# nuxt-blog

> Blog created with Vue, Vuex & Nuxt to demonstrate full functionality of Nuxt. It has standard blog functionality where you can register, login, create your own posts, edit them and so on. For this project, I used Firebase as my database and Axios to make http calls.

> In order to use this application, you will have to make edits in the code, for env variables in nuxt.config.js and changes in the store folder(index.js). To summarize, you will have to edit Axios calls to connect them to Your Firebase instance.

> I hope this will help you get a better understanding of Nuxt structure and how useful it can be.

> Enjoy and have fun :)
